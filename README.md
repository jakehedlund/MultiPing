# Multi Ping
Ever have a bunch of command windows open, all pinging away? Now you don't need to! 

Multi ping is a small little program that simply shows the current ping status (and latency) of multiple (infinite?) IP addresses. Addresses and descriptions/labels are loaded via a text file. 

## Features
* Status of each IP address indicated visually. 
* Load IP address lists via a file. 
* Always-on-top option. 
* Enable checkbox for each IP.
